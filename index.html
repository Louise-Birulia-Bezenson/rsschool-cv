                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Now my priority is education. I spend a lot of time on self-study and also study with a tutor and take online courses. At the previous place of work, the ability to study independently helped me to quickly grow up the career ladder.</p>
                <p>I started my career as a junior analyst, worked hard and asked for additional tasks, as a result, after 2 years I took the position of director of marketing.</p>
                <p>I am very sociable, so it was easy for me to manage the team. In addition to management, my tasks included: analysis of the market and marketing indicators, distribution of the budget of advertising companies, implementation of automatic sales funnels, a set of financial statements and communication with the franchisee.</p>
